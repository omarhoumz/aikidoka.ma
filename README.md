## ⚡️ Quick Start

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/project?template=https://github.com/omarhoumz/ts-tailwind-nextjs-starter.git)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Run the following command to create a new project with this Starter:

```
yarn create next-app my-app -e https://github.com/omarhoumz/nextjs-ts-tailwind-starter
```

**or**

```
npx create-next-app my-app -e https://github.com/omarhoumz/nextjs-ts-tailwind-starter
```

Once the project and dependencies are finished installing, you can navigate to that directory and start up the development server with:

```
yarn dev
```

**or**

```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see your new project!

## 🧐 What's inside?

- Tailwind CSS
- My prefered prettierrc config (from [here](https://gist.github.com/omhoumz/c87e52ee14e88d0898eb582a823dd744#file-prettierrc))

The rest of the Starter is based off of the typescript Next.js default starter.
